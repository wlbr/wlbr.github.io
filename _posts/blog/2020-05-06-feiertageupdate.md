title: "Yet another of my library FEIERTAGE"
date: 2020-05-04

On the radion, just yesterday morning I heard that VE-Day will be a public holiday just in 2020 in Berlin only. So I had to add this to the library [_feiertage_](https://github.com/wlbr/feiertage).

The new public holiday is actually called _Tag der Befreiung_ (Day of liberation) and there are some discussions in Germany to declare that as a new public holiday throughout the country. Because of the possible multiple and really different interpretations of that day for Germany that discussion did not lead to a decision and probably never will.

But Berlin decided this small step on its on rights. In 2020, for the 75th return of WW2's end (at least in Europe), it is a public holiday in Berlin.
