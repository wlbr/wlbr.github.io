title: "Yet another update of FEIERTAGE"

On the radio, just yesterday morning, I heard that VE-Day will be a public holiday just in 2020 in Berlin only. So I had to add this to the library [_feiertage_](https://github.com/wlbr/feiertage).

The new public holiday is actually called _Tag der Befreiung_ (Day of liberation) and there are some discussions in Germany to declare that as a new public holiday throughout the country. Because of the possible multiple and really different interpretations of that day for Germany that discussion did not lead to a decision and probably never will.

But Berlin decided to do this small step on its on rights. In 2020, for the 75th return of WW2's end (at least in Europe), it is a public holiday in Berlin.
