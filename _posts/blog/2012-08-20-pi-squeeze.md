Linux is installed (first Arch (boots really quickly), but then Debian,
as I am simply used to it).

Finally I got a SqueezeBox software renderer running on the box.
So now I am able to use the Pi to play my music stored on a cheap
NAS through my quite old stereo. The trick: the official Logitech
Squeezebox App for IPhone is now my Rasperry Pi remote. No need
for a display/TV!

As I have a really bad terrestrial radio reception in my house I
can now use the Pi to play a huge number of internet radios. Again
controlled by the IPhone.

I was waiting for ages for a cheap solution of this problem.
