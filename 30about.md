In the early eighties I bought a [Texas Instruments TI 99/4a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A) - unfortunately it was broken. And even more horrible: as TI stopped the production of that wonderful machine it was not possible to get a working replacement. I literally spent all my pennys to buy a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) instead. And so it came that I lost some years to computer games :smirk:
But finally I ended up being interested in programming ...

Well, I studied that beast and got a more or less professional developer. Became a project manager, got to be the development manager, became the manager of development managers, recognizing that I _really_ missed programming. So after 16 years of being a manager I did a break and got back to doing things. I think my life is better now.


### Languages I got to get known eventually
My personal journey across the space of languages. I got quite good in some of them, but not that good in most, really.

* Commodore 64 Basic
* C64 machine language (or assembler as it would be called later. Using SMON)
* Pascal (Oxford Pascals on the C64, but much more Turbo Pascal on the PC)
* 80286 Assembler
* C, C++ (Turbo C)
* Bourne Shell
* Common Lisp (Macintosh Common Lisp (Mac) and Allegro Common Lisp (PC))
* Java
* Javascript (the old way)
* Python
* Google Go

You will find most of my side projects of the more recent years on my Github profile: [https://github.com/wlbr](https://github.com/wlbr)
While most of them are unfinished rubbish, some actually could be useful.  See [projects]({% link 20projects.md %}).
